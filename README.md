**TanaanTracker** is a lightweight **World of Warcraft** addon made especially for client version 7.3.5 (legion)@Tauri that helps you **track, share, and sync rare spawn timers** in **Tanaan Jungle**.  
It automatically logs rare kills, calculates respawn timers, and synchronizes data between guildmates and party members.

---

## 📘 Addon Overview

TanaanTracker keeps your rare data up to date in real time.  
When you kill a rare, it’s automatically recorded and displayed with a countdown until its respawn.  
The addon also syncs your data with others in your guild automatically so everyone stays updated effortlessly.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🕒 Real-Time Rare Tracking
- Automatically records when you kill each rare.  
- Displays the next estimated respawn time.  
- Works even after relogging — data is saved per realm.

### 🌍 Multi-Realm Support
- Track rares independently on each realm.  
- Quickly switch between realms using the dropdown at the top of the addon window.

### 🔄 Sync With Other Players
- **Automatic guild sync:** Timers are shared automatically between guild members.
- **Global Channel sync:** you can now try to check if users in your global realm channel got newer timers (1 hour cooldown, requires v2.3 for all users to work)
- **Manual sync:** Use `/tsync` to sync with others: </br>
`/tsync party` → Sync with your party </br>
`/tsync raid` → Sync with your raid </br>
`/tsync <player>` → sync via whisper

- All synced timers are merged intelligently — no duplicates or outdated overwrites.

### 🧭 TomTom Integration
- Each rare row includes two small buttons:
- `>` → Set TomTom waypoint  
- `X` → Clear all TomTom waypoints  
- Works seamlessly with the [TomTom](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom) addon to show in-game navigation arrows.

### 🔔 Alerts & Reminders
- Receive visual and sound alerts **5 minutes** and **1 minute** before a rare respawns.  
- Alerts are hidden while in combat to avoid distractions.
- You can toggle the alerts on and off at any time from the UI.

### 💬 Auto-Announce Kills
- Optionally announces your rare kills to your **guild chat** automatically:
[G] [You]: Terrorfist down — respawn ~60m

- Easily toggle this behavior using the **Auto Announce** checkbox in the top-right corner of the addon window.

### 🧩 ElvUI Integration
- Integrates smoothly with [ElvUI](https://www.tukui.org/) for a consistent visual theme.  
- The dropdown, TomTom buttons, and close button adopt ElvUI’s skin automatically.
